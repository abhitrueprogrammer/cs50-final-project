Write pseudocode first when creating a big project, then try to implement as much as you can as fast as you can(keeping a note of what you haven't implemented yet). Go with the flow after that(whatever things are required to be done). Even new creative ideas will generate with time. 

Write down all the ideas(project names) that occur to you and start to work right away. See one through the end
